## Hey, I'm Kevin! 👋
I'm a Computer Science student at UBC and a software engineer who loves building **scalable backend systems**, and **full-stack applications**. More recently, I've been exploring lower-level concepts and experimenting with systems that prioritize speed, efficiency, and clean architecture.

## Current Interests
Diving into C++, gRPC, and trading-system architecture to understand low-latency design and service communication.

## Dev Stack
**Languages:** Java, Python, TypeScript, C++, Go  
**Frameworks/Tools:** React, Node.js, Spring Boot, Flask, Docker, AWS, Redis, Postgres, Firebase, gRPC  

## Connect With Me
**LinkedIn:** https://linkedin.com/in/klei05  
**Email:** kevinleimc@gmail.com  

Thanks for stopping by! Always open to connecting, building cool stuff, or chatting about systems, performance, and new ideas.
